# Deploy CISCAPPS

You are now ready to deploy CISCAPPS.

Run the command :
```Shell
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

The `-d` means that the container will run as a daemon in the background.

This will pull the CISCAPPS image from Docker Hub and deploy it in a container.
It shouldn't take more than 5-10 minutes.

Your CISCAPPS installation should now be accessible! You can test it out in a web browser.
