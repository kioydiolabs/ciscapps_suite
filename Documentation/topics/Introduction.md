## What's CISCAPPS?
In 2009 Cisco released the 79XX IP deskphone series, which could be configured to access XML applications.
Those were applications coded in a proprietary XML format that the phones could read. \
\
Many software companies released apps for the phones at the time.
However, there are none available today. \

CISCAPPS, is a suite of XML apps developed for the 79XX deskhpones, such as a simple weather app or a rock,
paper, scissors anyone who has a 79XX deskphone and wants to experiment with it,
or even for businesses who still use them.
