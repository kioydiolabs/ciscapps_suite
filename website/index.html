                <p>
                    In 2009 Cisco released the 79XX IP deskphone series.
                    Those VoIP phones could be configured to access XML applications.
                    Those were applications coded in a proprietary XML format that the phones
                    could read. Many software companies released apps for the phones at the time.
                    However, there are none available today. CISCAPPS, is a suite of XML apps
                    developed for the 79XX deskhpones, such as a simple weather app or a rock, paper,
                    scissors anyone who has a 79XX deskphone and wants to experiment with it,
                    or even for businesses who still use them.
